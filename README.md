# Pulse-Width-Modulation

Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) is a technique used to control the amount of power delivered to an electrical device by varying the width of pulses in a periodic waveform. It is commonly used in applications like Speed control in DC motors,Brightness adjustment in LED lighting,Audio signal generation,Voltage regulation in power supplies.
Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) is a method of controlling power delivery by adjusting the width of pulses in a periodic signal. It is widely used for speed control in motors, dimming LEDs, and regulating voltage in power supplies.
